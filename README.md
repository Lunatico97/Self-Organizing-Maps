# Self-Organizing-Maps
- Understanding SOMs and its usecases in clustering and color segmentation !
- Make sure you open the notebook itself where everything is explained from basics to its applications !
- What did I actually do here ?
  1. Use SOM for color clustering to differentiate shades of color
